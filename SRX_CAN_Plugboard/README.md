# SRX CAN Plugboard
Provides a spring plug for the SRX for connecting to the CAN network, similar to the other 2015 control system devices. This enables you to cut the wires shorter, and use Ferrule terminators instead of splicing.

## Assembly
No special notes. Simply solder components to the board. 

## Mounting
Can be mounted with either screws or zip ties. Mounting holes and zip tie indents are spaced 1" apart on either side of the connector.

This cannot be mounted directly on conductive surfaces. Doing so will likely short the CAN connections, halting the robot. It's suggested to add a wood block or other spacer when mounting on a surface that may cause the pins to short.

## FRC Technicalities
This is a passive wiring board, and contains no active components.
